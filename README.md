# Infinite Arkanoid
A arkanoid-like game with procedural level generation and infinite levels.

Key Features:
- Quest Mode: Include 5 randomly generated levels ordered by increasing difficulty
- Infinite Mode: Infinite amount of levels which procedurally generated
- Pause menu: You can pass any level and open Cheat Mode to review the game easily
- Cheat Mode: Ball won't blow up, for testing and reviewing

Technical Notes:
- Levels are generated by breakable and unbreakable brick density
- Each levels are 15x10 matrixes
- Difficulty of a level calculated by this formula:
Difficulty = 25 * count(unbreakable) + for each breakable (manhattan distance to 16.row of breakable)
- CalculatingLevelComplexity also check that whether the level is achievable or not
If any of the breakable brick is not reachable from 16th row, this shows level is not achievable
When this situation occured, level is generated from the started, before the rendering on the game scene.
- Each playthrough generats different levels
- Both tweens and sprite animations are used for the visual animations and juice
